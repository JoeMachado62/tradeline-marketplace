(Rev. August 2025) 1
TRADELINE USER AGREEMENT
PARTIES. This agreement is between Credit Services US, LLC (hereinafter “Company”) and the undersigned client
(hereinafter “Client”). By signing this agreement, Client certifies that he/she is at least 18 years of age, that the
information he/she has provided to Company is true and complete, that he/she is legally authorized to enter into this
agreement and authorize the actions of Company as set forth herein, and that he/she will not use any of the products of
Company or any information provided by Company for any unlawful or deceptive purpose.
DEFINITION OF TRADELINE. The term “tradeline” refers to the line-item for a credit account on a credit bureau report.
As used throughout this agreement the term refers to a line of revolving credit, such as a credit card, which forms the
basis of the credit bureau report. Client will be added as an "Authorized User" onto the purchased line of credit,
resulting in the tradeline also appearing on Client's credit bureau report.
TRADELINE PRODUCT. Company agrees to use its best efforts to perform all functions necessary to have Client added as
an "Authorized User" to the tradelines he/she selected to report to his/her credit report by the last day in the advertised
Reporting Period. It is understood and agreed by both parties that Client will maintain “Authorized User” status on those
tradelines for two (2) billing/posting cycles for each tradeline after being added thereto, after which he/she will be
removed therefrom. Accordingly, it is the understanding and intent of the parties that Client will receive two
consecutive postings of each tradeline to his/her credit bureau report and this “Authorized User” status shall be
reported by two (2) or more credit bureaus. The parties further understand and agree that Client will only be added to
tradelines with the full advance knowledge, consent, and participation of the primary account holder of the account to
which that tradeline pertains. Company shall coordinate with the primary account holder of the account(s) (“Company
Credit Sponsors”) to ensure the Client is added as an authorized user. While Company does not have direct control over
such, Company Credit Sponsors are expected to maintain low balances on their accounts (15% or less of the total credit
limit) while a client is an active authorized user and they are expected to keep their accounts in good standing with on
time payments. Highest balance may report on the tradeline as a historic factor, which may be above 15% of the credit
line, and Client understands this is entirely separate from the current utilization. Tradelines in which Client has been
added to may exhibit historical disputed or similar comments. Client understands and accepts the absence of late
payments is presumed to be proof of on-time payments as it relates to any given tradeline.
FEES. Client agrees to pay the non-refundable fee specified on the selected tradelines for purchase during checkout.
Client understands and agrees that this fee is to be paid in full prior to the delivery of tradeline product. Client
understands and agrees that the tradeline order will not be processed until Company has received the entire fee, and
that all fee payments received are to be considered earned upon receipt and non-refundable, unless a non-posting or
non-performance by Company occurs. Client further agrees that in the event any method of payment is returned or
declined for any reason, Company may remove that Client from any tradeline to which that Client has been added and
cancel the order.
ABSENCE OF GUARANTEE OR SERVICES PROVIDED. Client understands and agrees that Company cannot, and does not,
make any predictions, promises, guarantees, warranties or assurances of any kind with regard to the result or effect of
its product on Client’s credit score or other component of credit worthiness. Company does not make any claims as to
the improvement of the Client’s credit rating or the removal or correction of any items (derogatory or otherwise)
appearing on the Client’s credit report(s). Client understands that by using Company’s website platform and products,
the Client’s credit rating may in fact decline.
WARRANTIES. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. No other promise, other than what is
stated paragraph: PROOF OF NON-PERFORMANCE / NON-POSTING FOR REFUND OR EXCHANGE, has been made to
the client, and the client specifically agrees that no additional promises, representations, or express and/or implied
2
warranties other than those terms spelled out in this Agreement were made with respect to the services to be
rendered or outcome to be achieved.
PROOF OF NON-PERFORMANCE / NON-POSTING FOR REFUND OR EXCHANGE. The parties acknowledge and agree that
non-postings may occur and, in this event, we offer a “money back guarantee” and not an “absolute guarantee” of a
tradeline posting. Therefore, in the event Client’s authorized user status has not posted to two (2) of the credit bureaus
in accordance with the “TRADELINE PRODUCT” clause above within the reporting period, and the Client has not
requested they be removed from a given tradeline, Company shall per the Client’s choice either provide a full refund of
the Client’s fees or an exchange for another tradeline. Company will be obligated to provide the Client with the refund
or exchange within fifteen (15) days of the date it receives written proof from the Client of Company’s non-performance,
provided such written proof is received by Company via email within twenty one (21) days of the date by which Client’s
tradeline should have been reported by as set forth in the “TRADELINE PRODUCT” clause above. The instructions and
procedure to report proof of non-performance for a full refund or exchange are as follows:
If the reporting period has passed and your tradeline still has not reported, please create a CreditKarma.com account
and confirm the following:

1. Confirm that your credit report has been updated after the last date within the reporting period.
2. Confirm that the tradeline is not being reported on both TransUnion and Equifax. (If it is being reported on 1 of
   the bureaus listed on Credit Karma but not the other, please see additional instructions below.)
   If you are able to confirm both of these points above, then you may request a refund or exchange on the given tradeline.
   Additionally, Company reserves the right to issue only a refund in certain circumstances and reserves the right to choose
   to not process any future orders for any reason.
   All refund or exchange requests must be in writing. Our customer service phone line does not process refunds,
   exchanges, or have full access to your order information. Please email MyCreditServiceUS@gmail.com with the
   following information:
3. Your Name
4. The Card ID for the tradeline you are requesting a refund on. (The format of the Card ID looks like 1234)
5. Provide your username and password for your Credit Karma account. If your creditkarma.com account does
   show the tradeline posted to at least 1 bureau (either TransUnion or Equifax), we will need to look at your
   Experian data in order to prove that it did not report to at least 2 bureaus. Should that occur, Company will
   notify you of such and request you provide a current copy of your Experian credit report to be obtained by you
   from Experian.com.
6. Whether you prefer to receive a refund or an exchange
   As an alternative to Credit Karma, you may also submit updated .pdf credit reports for the bureaus you are reporting a
   non-posting for, or full reports downloaded from AnnualCreditReport.com. Your submission must include the entire
   credit report. We may also accept updated credit reports downloaded from myFICO.com or directly from each credit
   bureau's website, certain tri-merge credit reports such as ones used in a mortgage credit pull. We do not accept
   screenshots.
   Our refund department will confirm this information within three (3) business days and once confirmed, Company will
   issue a refund or exchange on that tradeline within four (4) business days in addition to the time it may take to complete
   the fund transfer. The Client should receive the refund within fifteen business (15) days. The refund department is
   closed on weekends.
   Client agrees, understands, and certifies that they must remove any credit freezes, and / or fraud alerts from each of the
   three major bureaus in order for a tradeline to post. Also, Client understands that if they have engaged in any credit
   sweeps, have ever had any derogatory accounts with any of the banks they are buying a tradeline from, including 90 day
   3
   or more late payments, collections, or charge offs due to bankruptcy, in any of these events, the tradeline likely will not
   post. Also, Client understands that they must have an up to date address that can be verified within the bank’s
   verification systems, as well as the credit bureaus, and all information must be completely accurate with no misspellings
   or typos. If Client breaches any of these requirements, a non-posting may occur and Company is not obligated to issue
   a refund or exchange due to Client’s breach of this agreement.
   AUTHORIZATION/USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. Client hereby grants to Company full authority to use his/her
   information for the sole purpose of adding him/her to the selected tradeline. In furtherance thereof, Client authorizes
   Company to perform any and all acts necessary to accomplish the goals of this agreement and agrees to execute any and
   all documents necessary to facilitate Company’s performance hereunder, including but not limited to any power of
   attorney or letter of authorization. Client further authorizes Company to verify and validate through a professional third-
   party verification service of Company’s choice all information provided from the client including but not limited to
   driver’s license information, social security number, date of birth, full legal name, address, phone number, and any other
   information provided to Company. If Client does not provide Company with any documents it may request from Client
   within 48 hours, Client’s order may be cancelled.
   USE OF FALSE OR UNAUTHORIZED INFORMATION/CONTACTING LENDER. Client agrees that he/she will not use, provide,
   or submit to Company, any alternate Social Security Number (SSN), Credit Protection Number (CPN), Employer
   Identification Number (EIN), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), or any information that is false, fraudulent, illegal or
   unauthorized. Client agrees not to contact any lending institution wherein Client has been added as an authorized user,
   absent express written consent to do so from the account owner. Upon the discovery of such false, fraudulent, illegal, or
   unauthorized information, Company shall have the absolute right to terminate this agreement and remove the Client
   from any tradelines to which he/she has been added by Company and contact law enforcement authorities as necessary.
   Client agrees that in that event, any and all fees, costs and other money and funds of any kind paid to Company shall not
   be refunded to Client. It is further understood and agreed that if the Client provides any false, illegal or fraudulent
   information as described above, and Company sustains damages as a result, then Company’s damages are not to be
   limited to the fees or costs the Client has made to Company in furtherance of this Agreement. In such circumstances
   Company does not waive its ability to collect any and all damages to which it may be entitled under law or equity.
   ASSUMPTION OF RISK. Client understands and agrees that there exists an inherent risk in providing his/her personal
   information to Company, and Company in turn providing that personal information to Company Credit Sponsors on
   Client’s behalf. Additionally, Client understands there are risks to being associated with someone else’s tradelines as an
   Authorized User. Client understands that the Credit Sponsor’s lenders/credit card issuers may initiate fraud
   investigations regarding the addition of any authorized users to Credit Sponsor’s accounts and that claims of bank
   fraud may be brought against the Client by virtue of having been added as an authorized user to any of the Credit
   Sponsor’s accounts. Typically, it is the bank’s fraud department who looks into and deals with what they may perceive
   as “unusual” or “frequent” authorized user activity. Client further understands that the possibility of the Credit
   Sponsor’s defaulting on their tradeline, the possibility of the Credit Sponsors over utilizing their spending on their
   account by owing more than 15% of their total credit limit, and the possibility for the tradeline being closed exists. In any
   of these scenarios, Company shall issue the Client a full refund or exchange and Company shall be subject to the
   limitations on liability as set forth in the Limited Liability clause of this agreement.
   INDEMNIFICATION. Client shall fully indemnify, hold harmless and defend Company and its directors, officers,
   employees, agents, stockholders, representatives and affiliates from and against any and all claims, actions, suits,
   demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses including but not limited
   to attorney’s fees and costs, whether or not a third party claim, which arise out of, result from, or in any way relate to
   any breach of this agreement or of any legal duty owed to Company, any misrepresentation made to Company, or the
   providing of any false, fraudulent, illegal or unauthorized information to Company.
   DISCLAIMER. Client understands and agrees that any and all products offered by Company are intended to comply with
   all municipal, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations of every kind that may be applicable to
   4
   the products provided by Company. Client understands that Company does not condone the use of its products and
   services for any unlawful, fraudulent, dishonest, deceptive, unethical, or otherwise harmful activity of any kind. Client
   agrees that any products he/she receives from Company will be used only for lawful purposes, and that any unlawful,
   fraudulent, dishonest, unethical or otherwise harmful activity of any kind shall constitute an immediate material breach
   of this agreement, and that in any such event Company shall have the absolute right to terminate this agreement and
   remove the Client from any tradelines to which he/she has been added by Company. Client agrees that in that event,
   any and all fees, costs and other money and funds of any kind paid to Company shall not be refunded to Client, but shall
   be retained by Company. Client further understands and agrees that Company reserves the absolute right to cooperate
   fully with any investigation that may be conducted by any municipal, state, federal or other law enforcement or
   governmental regulatory agency, and to comply with any subpoena or other order issued by any court of competent
   jurisdiction or other governmental regulatory agency. Client further agrees to indemnify Company for any fines or other
   penalties of any kind that Company may incur as a result of Client’s failure or refusal to cooperate with any such
   investigation.
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Client agrees that any liability on the part of Company for any damage of any kind that may
   result from any alleged breach of any part of this agreement or any other act or omission alleged on the part of
   Company, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be limited to the amount of any fees actually paid by Client to
   Company under this agreement. Client further agrees that Company shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any
   third party, including but not limited to our credit Sponsor’s, without regard to whether that third party claims to be, or
   is in fact, acting on behalf of, at the direction of, or pursuant to any instructions or information provided by Company.
   NON-DISPARAGEMENT. Parties agree and covenant that they will not at any time, directly or indirectly, make, publish or
   communicate to any person or entity or in any public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments, or
   statements concerning each Party or its businesses, or any of its employees, officers, shareholders, members, and
   advisors. This Section does not, in any way, restrict or impede Parties from exercising protected rights to the extent that
   such rights cannot be waived by agreement or from complying with any applicable law or regulation or a valid order of a
   court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency, provided that such compliance does not exceed
   that required by the law, regulation, or order. Parties shall promptly provide written notice of any such order to the
   other Party. The Parties agree and covenant that they shall cause its officers, directors, employees, shareholders,
   members, and advisors to refrain from making any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments, or statements
   concerning the Parties or their businesses to any third parties.
   LIMITATION OF ACTIONS. Client agrees that no action, proceeding or litigation arising out of, with respect to, or in any
   way related to this agreement may be brought against Company more than six (6) months after the first date upon
   which the basis of that action could have reasonably been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

   Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration
   conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).

   party in prosecuting or defending that action.
